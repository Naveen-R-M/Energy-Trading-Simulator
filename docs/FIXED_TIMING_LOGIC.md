# 🔧 Fixed: hour_start_utc Logic + 30-Second Scheduler

## ✅ **Problem Fixed:**

**Before (Broken):**
- Order created at: `22:45:59`
- hour_start_utc: `22:45:45` ❌ (moderation time before creation time!)

**After (Fixed):**
- Order created at: `22:45:59`  
- hour_start_utc: `22:50:45` ✅ (next 5-min slot + 45s)

## 🕐 **New Logic Examples:**

### **Example 1: Order at 22:45:59**
- Current time: `22:45:59`
- Next 5-min mark: `22:50:00` (since we're past 22:45:45)
- Moderation time: `22:50:45` ✅
- **Result**: `hour_start_utc: "2025-08-17T22:50:45.000Z"`

### **Example 2: Order at 22:43:20**
- Current time: `22:43:20`
- Next 5-min mark: `22:45:00`
- Moderation time: `22:45:45` ✅
- **Result**: `hour_start_utc: "2025-08-17T22:45:45.000Z"`

### **Example 3: Order at exactly 22:45:00**
- Current time: `22:45:00`
- Logic: Since we're exactly at 5-min mark, move to next
- Next 5-min mark: `22:50:00`
- Moderation time: `22:50:45` ✅
- **Result**: `hour_start_utc: "2025-08-17T22:50:45.000Z"`

## 🤖 **Scheduler Updates:**

### **Check Interval: 30 Seconds**
- ✅ **Reduced frequency**: Checks every 30 seconds instead of 10
- ✅ **Still responsive**: Maximum 30-second delay after due time
- ✅ **Server efficient**: Lower CPU and resource usage
- ✅ **Batch processing**: Groups orders by same moderation time

### **Timeline Example:**
```
22:45:59 - Order created (hour_start_utc: 22:50:45)
22:46:00 - Scheduler check (order not due yet)
22:46:30 - Scheduler check (order not due yet)
22:47:00 - Scheduler check (order not due yet)
...
22:50:30 - Scheduler check (order not due yet)
22:51:00 - Scheduler check (order is due! Process it)
22:51:01 - Order moderated → APPROVED/REJECTED
```

## 🎯 **Safety Checks Implemented:**

1. **✅ Future Time Guarantee**: Always ensures moderation time > creation time
2. **✅ 10-Second Minimum**: At least 10 seconds in the future
3. **✅ 5-Minute Boundary**: Proper next 5-minute interval calculation
4. **✅ Hour Rollover**: Handles transitions across hour boundaries

## 🔍 **Test Your Fix:**

**Create a fake order now and check:**
```bash
# Check current order
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/fetch_orders

# Should show hour_start_utc > created_at ✅
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "created_at": "2025-08-17T22:48:30+00:00",
  "hour_start_utc": "2025-08-17T22:50:45.000Z",
  "status": "PENDING"
}
```

Your fake orders now have proper timing with `hour_start_utc` always in the future! 🎉
